<h1>The Best Movies According to Rebecca</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Disneys The Sword in the Stone</h3>
<p>This is my favourite cartoon kids movie. I love the songs and the movie reminds me of relaxing sholdooh weekends. It's nostalgia for me.</p>
<h3>Black Sheep</h3>
<p>Not for the faint hearted, this black humor, graphic movie made me cringe and laugh at the same time.</p>
<h3>Agent Argyle</h3>
<p>I watched this at the movies this year (2023) and loved the action, plot twists and fun of the whole thing.</p>
