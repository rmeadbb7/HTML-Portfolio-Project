<p> Being born in 1981, I was blessed with a childhood that mixed old skool push-bike gangs with a Commodore 64 MS Dos Comupter. 
  I still remember how excited my brother and I were when we first played Rouge an the bad guys were "Z" symbols. The excitement of computers changing our lives was everywhere.
  I was lucky to have a computer savy family and a was Dux of my year 12 graduate group in computing. This MS-dos foundation gave me a familiar comfort around computers. 
  Althouth I didn't persure it as a career path leaving school, it has always served me with my day-to-day problem solving. 
  I seemed to end up the IT person no matter what filed I worked in. 
</p>

<p>After working in a number of different fields, I am now returning to the world of computers. I am reminding myself and building my knoweldge in HTLM and discovering Python, CSS and Java Script.
  I am thankful the training in touch typing in business school is paying off when I am writing code. 
  It is exciting coming back nto the world of computers and seeing how dynamic it has become in my lifetime. I am excited for the possibilitie of it in the future.
</p>

<p>When I am not building my knoweldge in how computers speak, I am reading, cooking and connecting with friends.
  I have a active interest in how the mind works and why we think and feel the way we do and love sitting at a great coffee shop (coffe is life) with a good book and people watching.
Watching day-to-day life happen right in front of my eyes. </p>
